== Welcome to the Cyberismo Demo Project! 🚀

This demo showcases the Cyberismo solution in action.

=== Secure development 🔐

Here’s what you can explore:

🔹 *Get Familiar with Secure Development.* Dive into the structure of an IoT device development project and see how everything fits together. 

🔹 *Test Automatic Progress Metrics.* Mark a development task as not required using the *Review as not applicable* workflow transition, and watch the progress metric update instantly.

🔹 *Adopt secure development gradually*. Change to a higher *Target adoption step* on xref:demo_t5svf1j8.adoc[IoT device] to see more tasks. Notice how the progress metrics update automatically.

🔹 *Explore How Tasks Interconnect.* Open xref:demo_2r2m785d.adoc[Document security context] and click *View process diagram* to visualize how tasks interconnect.

🔹 *Use the Awesome Modeling Tools.* Check out the xref:demo_xet5mvu8.adoc[Threat model for IoT device] and tweak the data flow model — the diagrams update automatically based on component and data flow changes!

🔹 *Trace Risks to Weaknesses & Requirements.* See how xref:demo_pfot2zzw.adoc[an example risk] links to xref:demo_s2rm9k2g.adoc[a weakness in the threat model] and a xref:demo_qylv7tsw.adoc[security requirement].

🔹 *Monitor Project Progress.* Visit xref:demo_6xk31ver.adoc[Periodic reviews] for an overview of the project's status.

🔹 *Create a New Project.* Click *Create* (top right) and start a new development project. Tip: Search for Start to quickly find the template.

Jump in and explore. Cyberismo makes security-driven development seamless! 🚀🔐

=== EU Cyber Resilience Act 🇪🇺

This demo environment includes the Cyberismo EU CRA module. 

NOTE: The EU CRA module is work in progress.

Here's how you can take it into use:

🔹 *Add Secure Development Tasks for EU CRA Compliance.* Click the buttons in the cards xref:demo_5gm7bidv.adoc[Design], xref:demo_5vydmajz.adoc[Implementation], xref:demo_1701fo5c.adoc[Verification], and xref:demo_tl9t2xz8.adoc[Releases] to add some more secure development tasks from the Cyberismo EU CRA module.

🔹 *Manage Technical Security Requirements.* Click the button *Add essential requirements from EU CRA module* in xref:demo_83qsnj1a.adoc[Security requirement specification for IoT device] to add placeholders for CRA essential requirements. Examine the new requirements and how they are linked to relevant secure development tasks automatically!

🔹 *Trace Compliance Requirements.* Click the button *Add compliance requirements from EU CRA module* under xref:demo_ci1tzban.adoc[Compliance] to add compliance requirements directly from the EU Cyber Resilience Act.

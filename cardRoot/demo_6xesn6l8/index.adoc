== Welcome to the Cyberismo Demo Project! 🚀

This demo showcases the Cyberismo solution in action.

=== Secure development 🔐

Here’s what you can explore:

🔹 *Get Familiar with Secure Development.* Dive into the structure of an IoT device development project and see how everything fits together. 

🔹 *Test Automatic Progress Metrics.* Mark a development task as not required using the *Review as not applicable* workflow transition, and watch the progress metric update instantly. Notice how the tool will require you to enter a justification before this transition can be executed. 

🔹 *Adopt secure development gradually*. The secure development essentials content module groups secure development tasks into three adoption steps for easier gradual adoption. Change to a higher *Target adoption step* on xref:demo_9rjvbbs6.adoc[IoT device] to see more tasks appear in the navigation. Notice how the progress metrics update automatically.

🔹 *Explore How Tasks Interconnect.* Open xref:demo_77von8m0.adoc[Document security context] and click *View process diagram* to visualize how tasks interconnect.

🔹 *Use the Awesome Modeling Tools.* Check out the xref:demo_vvey6cy4.adoc[Threat model for IoT device] and tweak the data flow model — the diagrams update automatically based on component and data flow changes!

🔹 *Trace Risks to Weaknesses & Requirements.* See how xref:demo_pfot2zzw.adoc[an example risk] links to xref:demo_s2rm9k2g.adoc[a weakness in the threat model] and a xref:demo_qylv7tsw.adoc[security requirement].

🔹 *Monitor Project Progress.* Visit xref:demo_d57mc9ut.adoc[Periodic reviews] for an overview of the project's status.

🔹 *Create a New Project.* Click *Create* (top right) and start a new development project. Tip: Search for Start to quickly find the template.

Jump in and explore. Cyberismo makes security-driven development seamless!

=== EU Cyber Resilience Act 🇪🇺

This demo environment includes the Cyberismo EU CRA module that includes tasks and templates for development teams of product manufacturers.

🔹 *Secure Development Tasks for EU CRA Compliance.* Tasks from the EU CRA module have been already added under the Design, Implementation, Verification, and Releases cards.

🔹 *Manage Technical Security Requirements.* Click the button *Add essential requirements from EU CRA module* in xref:demo_83qsnj1a.adoc[Security requirement specification for IoT device] to add placeholders for CRA essential requirements. Examine the new requirements and how they are linked to relevant secure development tasks automatically!

🔹 *Trace Compliance Requirements.* Click the button *Add compliance requirements from EU CRA module* under xref:demo_xv3mwohi.adoc[Compliance] to add compliance requirements directly from the EU Cyber Resilience Act.
